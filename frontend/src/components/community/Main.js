          The Uniques" is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive
          event experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and
          expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical
          appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or
          other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of event
          participants in any form. "The Uniques" takes violations of our policy
          seriously and will respond appropriately.

          <br />
          All participants of "The Uniques" events, including in-person and
          online attendees, event staff, speakers, and "Uniques," must abide by
          the following policy:

          <div>
            <b className="w-[fit-content]">Be respectful to each other.</b>
            <span>
              Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that
              everyone deserves to be here — and each of us has the right to
              enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination,
              or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. All
              forms of communication should not demean others. Consider what you
              are saying and how it would feel if it were said to you or about
              you.

              Speak up if you see or hear something.
            </b>
            <span>
              Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely
              engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you
              feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and
              politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.

            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
            comply immediately. Our zero tolerance policy means that we will
            look into and review every allegation of violation of our Event
            Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy and respond
            appropriately. To report any behavior that makes you or others feel
            uncomfortable, visit your event's website to file a report to your
            event's organizers.

            This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, codelabs, social
            media, all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, staff, etc.
            You catch our drift. "The Uniques" reserves the right to refuse
            admittance to, or remove any person from, any "The Uniques" hosted
            event (including future "The Uniques" events) at any time in its

            behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with this
            policy, and the terms and conditions herein. If a participant
            engages in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, the conference
            organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
            warning or expelling the offender from the conference with no refund
            or blocking the offender’s account from participating online.
